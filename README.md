# 🌌 2D Planetary Motion Simulation

Welcome to the **2D Planetary Motion Simulation**! This project visualizes the fascinating orbits of planets around the Sun using SFML in C++. 🪐🌞

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a graphical simulation of planetary motion in a 2D plane, inspired by our Solar System. Each planet orbits the Sun at varying speeds and distances, providing an intuitive representation of celestial mechanics. You can visualize planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, complete with orbit paths and names.

### Features:
- 🌞 **Realistic Orbital Motion**: Watch planets orbit the Sun with varying speeds and distances.
- 🪐 **Planetary Details**: Each planet is named and colored uniquely, with their orbits clearly shown.
- 🌠 **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily modify the simulation parameters to add more planets or change their behaviors.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Visualization**: Smooth animations with SFML graphics, designed for a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have `g++` installed.
- **SFML Library**: Install SFML on your system:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

### Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/planetary-motion-simulation.git
cd planetary-motion-simulation

Compile the project:
g++ PlanetaryMotion.cpp -o PlanetaryMotion -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

Run the executable:
./PlanetaryMotion

### Customization

Modify the Planets: Open PlanetaryMotion.cpp and adjust the planets vector to add new planets or change existing parameters like distance, speed, or color.
Change the Background: Customize the background color or add your own textures to enhance the visual appeal.
